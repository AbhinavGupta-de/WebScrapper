# Price Comparison Tool

## Overview

This Python script allows you to compare the prices of a product from different e-commerce websites. By providing the URL of the product, the script scrapes the websites to obtain price information and then compares the prices. It then displays the website where the product is available at the best price.

## Features

- Supports price comparison between Amazon and Flipkart.
- Retrieves the product name and price from the selected website.
- Helps you find the best price for a product from the supported websites.
